# instagram-screenshot-views-scraper

Due to restrictions the amount of views for an instagram post isn't attainable through the API.

Using [Andy](http://www.andyroid.net/), an android emulator for Mac OSX and Windows, I created this solution in a hurry. I warn you, it's not pretty.

Access an instagram account using Andy, start the program (some adjustments might be needed for setting the capture area of the screen), choose the Andy window, and grab a :beer:!

The result of the scrape saves the amount of views in a .txt file and that's it.
